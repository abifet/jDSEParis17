title: Finding Adam in randomly growing trees
abstract: Many large networks are formed by dynamic growth that can be modelled by simple random mechanisms. A natural problem is to discover the "past" of such networks by merely observing their present state. This talk addresses one of the simplest such problems one may formulate &#58 find the the first vertex in large random trees generated by either the uniform attachment or preferential attachment model. We study algorithms that, upon observing the tree, output a set of K vertices. We require that, with probability at least 1 – ε, the first vertex is in this set. We show that for any ε, there exist such algorithms with K independent of the size of the tree. The talk is based on joint work with Seb Bubeck and Luc Devroye.
